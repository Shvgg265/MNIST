This is a simple neural network that is trained on the MNIST dataset. 

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. 
Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The mnist_train.csv file contains the 60,000 training examples and labels. The mnist_test.csv contains 10,000 test examples and labels. 
Each row consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).
